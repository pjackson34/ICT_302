My name is Parker Jackson and I am  Senior ICT major at UK with a focus in Technology Management. I love almost everything that has to do with technology and 
when I found ICT as a major I knew it was the right one for me. I even recently built my own computer and when I completed it, it showed me that as long as you
take the time to research and learn how to do new things, you can do whatever you put your mind to! Usually in my free time I like to either play video games or 
play sports such as pick-up basketball. Also, I am a **HUGE** baseball fan. I have played baseball since I was about 5 years old and I have loved it ever since. I almost decided to play in college but I figured it was time to put that aside and focus on my education. My favorite team is the [Cincinnati Reds](https://www.mlb.com/reds), and I usually go to Cincinnati in the summers to watch them play (even though it's tough being a Reds fan sometimes).
