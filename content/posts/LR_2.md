 I think that this week the biggest learning objective we had to implement was "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning." We had to use outside sources to learn 
 some HTML, CSS, and Markdown. I think the resources provided were very useful and it helped me complete the Introduction page for Netlify. This week also helped me understand
 Content Management Systems a little more in the sense of how they work and how to use them. As with last week, I don't think we were neccesarily able to compare and contrast CMS's 
 becasue we've only used Github/Netlify so far. We also went over what makes something content and what doesn't make something content. I think this is a good starting point in 
 learning the key concepts in web content management
