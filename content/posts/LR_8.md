## Week 8
- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
I can do this by knwoing how presentation and content work together to make a website complete and know how being able to
make those two things work together will keep an audience engaged. 
- I can describe and compare content management systems.
I can now do this I believe very well because we are starting to look at a lot of different CMS's in class. This week I looked
at a CMS called Jekyll and a CMS called Moodle. One was an educational website and the other was a blogging CMS.
- I can manage content using established workflows.
I can do this by working with my group to decide how we would get our blg post up for the week. This includes creating a
workflow to get a draft, editing, a second draft, and a finalization.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
I can do this by creating a posts on Hugo and WordPress. We have been using these in class for weekly blog posts.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
I can do this especially recently by figuring out how to navigate WordPress and other CMS's by jst looking through them and seeing what
features all the different ones offer.
