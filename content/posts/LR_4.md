    This week we dove deeper into Content Management Systems by creating a dummy website which I think really helped to reinforce being able
  to identify and employ technologies related to CMS's. I also think that by going back to previous modules to make sure I was doing everything
  correctly was a good way to find and use resources for self-directed learning. I used an established workflow by doing the dummy website by
  laying out a plan for myself and following the steps I laid out. I still do not think we are able to compare and contrast content management systems 
  yet because we have not started our WordPress blogs yet. Lastly, I can identify key concepts in content management by knowing what can make a CMS
  either attract or push away customers by their strengths and weaknesses in regards to ease of use, design, compatability, flexibility, and other 
  determining factors.
