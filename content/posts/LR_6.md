 ## Week 6
 * I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
 I can do this by carrying what we learned last week over to this week. Knowing the difference between presentation and content
 really helps to bring a page together and give the audience a feeling that your site has what they need or are looking for.
 * I can describe and compare content management systems.
 I can do this now, starting this week becasue we have finally started to get familiar with WordPress and Hugo. I think
 overall WordPress feels more smooth to work with and has a better overall look as compared to Hugo. 
 * I can manage content using established workflows.
 I can do this by following a workflow that our group has set in the Microsoft Teams app. This includes brainstorming, drafting, 
 editing, and finalizing projects that we need to do. 
 * I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
 I can do this by using WordPress and continuing to grow my Hugo page as the weeks progress. I think that familiarizing myself more
 and more will help keep my knowledge of how CMS's work gradually increasing.
 * I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
 I think that this week I was able to do this by looking up some more Markdown elements and using them. I also had to do this
 to find some outside sources for if I ever had problems or questions with WordPress. I found the WordPress subreddit and
 I think that might be very useful in the future.
