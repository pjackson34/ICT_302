### Week 5
This week I was able to identify key concepts in Content Management Systems by learning the difference between content and presentation and how they
work together to make a website what it truly is. Presentation plays a larger role in keeping audiences engaged than what we may think. I do not think 
I am yet able to compare and contrast CMS's because we have still only used Hugo up to week 5. I am able to manage content using established workflows by 
planning out assignments and blog posts and following the steps until complete. I further learned how to identify and empoy new technologies in CMS's
by changing the theme of my hugo site. Lastly, I was able to find and use resources for self-directed learning by finding the CSS files in Github. I did
not change the CSS style sheet for my website, but I did figure out where to look to find it in case I ever decide I want to.
