Through the first week of class, I believe I can manage content using established workflows, I can identify and employ technologies related to content management, and I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. 
I did all of these 'I can' statement by following the directions that were posted on canvas and working through each step slowly and accurately. This week established the grounds for what some of the class will look like, but I dont think
that I learned all of the 'I can' statements. For example, I don't think that we went over key concepts to web content management or have enough information to really compare and contrast different content management syastems.
