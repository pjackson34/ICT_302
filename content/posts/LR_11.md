### Week 11
-  I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
This week we looked at different types of content including, hierarchial, relational, network, and static and how
Canvas uses these types of content. This can be applied to how we use content on our own pages in the future.
- I can describe and compare content management systems.
This week we looked at the differences between WordPress and Hugo and their ways in which they use content on the 
developer side and the consumer side. 
- I can manage content using established workflows.
We did this in week 11 by using our group Workflow to complete the group projects. We had someone make
a first draft which then turned into someone developing it an adding it to WordPress as a draft. Someone
then went in and revised it, and lastly, it got finalized. 
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
I can do this by creating posts in WordPress. I was not the developer for our group assignment this
week but I was last week. Me and another memeber of my group switch off blog posts each week. 
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
I have done this in the past by using my resources to learn new markdown elements and to post things onto
WordPress before I had known how to really use it.
