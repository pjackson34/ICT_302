I think the most relevant "I can" statement we worked on in Week 3 was "I can manage content using established workflows." We did this during
the in class activity on Zoom by creating a workflow in our groups using Microsoft teams and adding a KanBan tab. We established when and how we 
would accomplish taks by adding 'Buckets.' We were able to find resources for self-directed learning through the activity in which we had
to go into MS Teams and add a planner folder for ourselves. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management systems by using
sites such as Github, Netlify, and as of week 3, establishing workflows. I do not believe we can compare and contrast CMS' yet becasue we have only
used Hugo so far. Lastly, we have learned some key concepts of Content Management such as front and back end strategists, and also how everyone on
a CMS team should share the same mission and work together to reach it. Everyone has a role and each role is intertwined in some way.
