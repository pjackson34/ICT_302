### Week 9
-  I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
This week we looked at effective peer feedback and how this may help to improve quality of content that you
maybe putting onto your website. Having someone else look over your work and seeing it from their perspective
may help you know what can be improved upon or added/removed from your content.
- I can describe and compare content management systems.
This week we got to see the similarities and differences between how WordPress uses the 'pages' feature
and how Hugo uses their pages. I think WordPress is more user friendly in adding pages becausse you just
click the tab on the left side. Hugo makes you go into the code and add a page. 
- I can manage content using established workflows.
We did this in week 9 by using our group Workflow to complete the group projects. We had someone make
a first draft which then turned into someone developing it an adding it to WordPress as a draft. Someone
then went in and revised it, and lastly, it got finalized. 
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
I can do this by creating pages in WordPress. I was the developer for 2 of our group assignments this
week so I had to go in and add a new page and write all the code and enter the draft for those assignments.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
I did this by using my resources to figure out how to add a page to WordPress, although it was pretty self-
explanatory, I had never done it before.
