- #### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
We have looked at many key concepts in Content Management Systems and how they are used in changing how your audience
views your content. We have seen how effective peer review can be used to improve your content. We have looked at back-
end and front end development, to see how they work together to bring content to the point where it needs to be. I believe 
the most important one we have looked at so far this semester is how presentation and content come together to make a page,
a post, a blog, whatever it may be, into a piece of work that meets the standard your audience is looking for. The interdependence 
of these two variables can either make or break your project and how you want your information to get across to your audience.

- #### I can describe and compare content management systems.
I think after Week 8 this 'I can' statement became a lot easier for me to see and complete. We looked at a list of CMS's and had
to choose 2 to examine and describe. I had never really thought about how many types of Content Management Systems were really out 
there. I think the one I found the most intriguing was *Moodle.* This was an educational CMS tat reminded me a lot of something like
Canvas and Blackboard. They even had a tab where you could login as a fake student or teacher and see how it would work if you decided
to use this CMS. In terms of WordPress and Hugo, I think WordPress may be a little more user friendly and easier to navigate for 
someone who has never really used very many CMS's. 

- #### I can manage content using established workflows.
We have mainly completed this 'I can' statement through working with our groups. Earlier in the semester we met with our groups
and created workflows to use in determining how we would complete our assignments each week. My group decided it was best to split
up the group into 2 writers/editors, 2 developers, and an administrator. The writers and developers switch weeks on doing the blog 
posts. We create a first draft of our blog, then we develop it and post it as a draft. An editor will then go through to make sure
everything is how it should look and suggest things to improve upon the post. Lastly, the administrator will finalize the post and
submit it for grading.

- #### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
I can do this by creating posts and pages in Hugo and WordPress. We have to submit weekly learning reports in Hugo, and by now I
can do this without looking back at the instructions on how to do it. We also created an introduction page and a whole dummy website
on Hugo which helped me get more familiar with the site. We learned some basic markdown syntax and how to use it to make our posts
a little more complete. We use WordPress to create out group blog posts each week and I am now getting used to using it. I am a developer
for my group so I write any code for the draft and add pictures, html, links, etc...

- #### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
I can do this by using my resources I have to my advantage and finding what I need by myself. We are not always given the exact 
instructions step-by-step to complete a certain task. I have used the internet to look up some HTML and markdown syntax that
I may have forgotten or may have never used. I did this especially when first getting into WordPress because I wasn't super familiar 
with it. I think this will help me in the future because not everything will just be given to you. You must use any resource you have
available to complete the task you are presented with.
